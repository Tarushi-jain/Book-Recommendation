Collect Data: You need to gather data about books and users who have read them. You can use various sources such as 
kaggle platform to obtain this data.

Create User-Item Matrix: Once you have collected the data, create a matrix that has users on one axis and books on the other. Each cell in the matrix represents the rating given by a user to a book.

Apply Collaborative Filtering: Use collaborative filtering techniques to recommend books to users. Collaborative filtering relies on finding similarities between users based on their ratings and recommending books that have been liked by similar users.

Normalize the Ratings: Before applying collaborative filtering, you may want to normalize the ratings. This ensures that users who rate everything highly or poorly do not skew the results.

Implement Recommender System: Finally, implement the recommender system and make book recommendations based on the collaborative filtering algorithm.

Here are some book recommendations using collaborative filtering:

"The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins
"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee
"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" by Stieg Larsson
"Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn
"The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown
These recommendations are based on the assumption that users who liked one book are likely to enjoy similar books. However, it's important to note that collaborative filtering is not always accurate and users may have varying tastes in books.
